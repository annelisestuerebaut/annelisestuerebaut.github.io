I am a bachelor student in modern languages at the [Université Catholique de Louvain][2] in Belgium and I made an exchange semester at the [University of Helsinki][1] from September to December 2019. My program at home consists of studying English and Spanish languages as a major and I also follow courses in communication studies as a minor. In order to improve my abilities in these two languages, I decided to make an exchange semester abroad and I chose Finland. It was totally new for me: new learning methods, another environment and way of life. I can only recommend other students to make an exchange abroad, it is impressive how enriching is this experience for your personal and professional lives.

I love reading since I was little, I never go out without a book in my bag. This passion for books has also generated an interest in writing and has led me to participate in an Belgian online platform of cultural journalism, [Karoo][3]. After my studies, I would love to transform this passion into a job.
